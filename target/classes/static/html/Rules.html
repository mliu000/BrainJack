        <h3 id="overview-of-blackjack">Overview of BrainJack</h3>
        <p>As this game builds upon the famous gambling game BlackJack, to know how to play BrainJack, we first need to learn how to play BlackJack. The rules to BlackJack are pretty simple. This game involves a standard deck of 52 Poker Cards (not including Jokers). There is a Dealer, and at least one player (up to four players for my version). At the start of each match, each player will set a bet. If the player wins that match, they win their bet, or gain the amount of money they decided to bet. If they lose that bet, they will lose the same amount of money. (So, you want to be wise with your money :D)
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-to-play-blackjack">How To Play BlackJack</h3>
        <p>You are playing against the dealer to win money (just for fun lol). Each player starts with 2 cards. The dealer also starts with 2 cards, but one of them is faced down. You as players will play first. You have 2 choices. You can "stand", which means they don't want to draw cards and want the game to move on, or you "hit", which means to draw a card. Each card has a score associated with it (see below). Your goal is to get a score as close to 21 pts as possible. This is because going over 21 pts is considered a "bust". If the dealer busts, you automatically win the match. If you "bust", then you automatically lose the match. To win the match, you must either have a score higher than the dealer, or the dealer must bust. If you decide to stand at a low score, you drastically increase the chances of the dealer having a higher score than you (and not busting). But if you "hit" at a high score, you risk busting and automatically losing the match. Therefore, you have to take a calculated risk. <br>
        <br> 
        The dealer also have a few restrictions. When the dealer plays, they must draw cards until they score is at least 17. This means there is a special case: If for example, you decide to stand at 12 pts, but the dealer draws a but has a greater score than you, lets say 15 pts. Since they haven't reached 17 points yet, they don't automatically win. They must continue to draw cards. If they bust afterwards, you still win :() <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The scores of the cards are as follows:</strong> <br>
        <br>
        - Number cards 2-10 are worth the same number of points of their number <br>
        - J, Q, K cards are all worth 10 points <br>
        - A cards are by default worth 11 points, but if you were to bust, the A cards automatically become 1 point. <br> <br>
        Note*: The suite of the card (Diamonds, Spades, etc) does not matter.
        </p>

        <p>Now that you already know the rules of BlackJack, let's talk about how the "Brain" aspect of BrainJack works. Basically, if you were to lose a match, you have the opportunity to only lose half the amount you betted. To do so, you will automatically be prompted to answer a randomly generated multiple choice question with 4 choices. You will have 10 seconds to answer. If you answer correctly, you will only lose half your bet. If you answer incorrectly, you will lose all your bet. Some questions will be about non-trivial topics, while other questions will be about common knowledge. Just try your best to guess correctly.</p>
